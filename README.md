Fences
======

This module adds a simple feature, a fence block. Each fence block can be
connected to up to four other blocks, with which it is lying side to side.
Currently, however, the module is a little bit bugged, which means, that the
fences will not get connected correctly the moment they are placed. However,
placing an arbitrary block right next to a wrongly placed fence and then mining
it again should fix the issue. Another problem this module currently have, is
that the ground right around fence is severely darkened. This module also misses
any sort of gate, although it used to have it in past.
